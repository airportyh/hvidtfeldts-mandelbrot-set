# GPU Accelerated Mandelbrot Set Viewer from hvidtfeldts.net

This code was extracted from http://hvidtfeldts.net/WebGL-DP/webgl.html, as a demo
from this article http://blog.hvidtfeldts.net/index.php/2012/07/double-precision-in-opengl-and-webgl/. It didn't run due to a minor GLSL compatability problem, I fixed that, and made other
simplifications in an effort to understand this code.
